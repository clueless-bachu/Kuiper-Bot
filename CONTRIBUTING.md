# Contributing to this Project
## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

Please avoid making changes to a single letterm word or line.
The absolute minimum could be adding decent comments for a function, class etc. Any Pull Requests that look obviously like spam or something done in 1-2 minute are 
highly discouraged. Please put in some effort to improve the code. Although for this project, I am literally asking to fix minor issues, try clumping a bunch of minor
issues to something that makes a pleasant difference

## Adding functionality to the ROS2 code
### Adding A*/Djikstra Path planner
If you can add A* or DJikstra path planner to this repository ideally in C++11, that would be awesome

### Priming project for OpenCV code

Any changes to CMakeLists, etc that would enable a source code to work with opencv in C++ is needed

### Adding a bash script to install all dependencies

Adding a simple bash file to install dependencies of the code will be appreciated

## Improving the API

### Switching to MQTT protocol

The Kuiper API was written in Flask Python keeping http/https in mind. In reality IoT systems use the MQTT protocol. 
Any starter code in this direction or a full revamp of the API is needed

### Improving Code quality

Quality can be improved by identifying potential bottlenecks. Just mentioning these bottlenecks will be highly appreciated. Any improvements are needed.

## Documentation and Commenting

A PDF file explaining the architecture of the system with images is needed

## Code cleanup

The general apppearance of the code is messy and illogical. Any cleanup like renaming variables properly, removing redundant lines etc are welcome.
